## Assignment 1: Text Processing with Python

[Assignment 1 Code](https://github.com/AustinGirouard/4395-HLT/blob/main/Assignment%201%20Files/main.py)

### What is this program?
This program takes a .csv file containing unclean employee information, cleans the data automatically and with user prompts, and stores it in a pickled dictionary. The goal of this assignment was to get a good introduction into the basics of text processing with Python.
### How do I run this program?
Run this program in the python terminal or command line **[NOTE: data.csv must be saved in a separate data folder within the python project]**
* (WINDOWS) `py main.py data/data.csv`
* (MAC) `python3 main.py data/data.csv`
### Strengths and Weaknesses of Python for Text Processing?
An important strength of Python is that it has many powerful built-in (and external) libraries available for simplifying text processing. Accessing and manipulating large sets of data is a simple task through the use of data structures like lists and dicts. One major weakness of Python when it comes to text processing is the fact that it tends to be quite slow in comparison to other languages. The ease-of-use and simplicity of the language plays a big role in the drop in efficiency.
### What I learned / What I reviewed
* Python is a powerful tool when it comes to text processing with simpler projects. As the size of the data gets larger, however, the language's lack in efficiency starts to show. 
* The pickle library is a tool that can serialize data into a binary stream.
* Python's built in string functions make breaking down text data a very simple task.
